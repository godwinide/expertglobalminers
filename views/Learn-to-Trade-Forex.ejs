				<p>One can easily notice from the above that U.S Dollar is a part of all the currency pairs as it is the world�s leading reserve currency and also involved in about 88% of currency trades taking place.</p>	
				
				<p>Minor currency pairs are the ones that do not include U.S Dollar in them. It is also called a cross-currency pair. Yen, Euro, and British pound are widely traded minor pairs. The following are the minor currency pairs:</p>
				
				<h5 class="text-left">�	EUR/GBP (EURO/ BRITISH POUND)</h5>

				<h5 class="text-left">�	NZD/JPY (NEW ZEALAND DOLLAR/ JAPANESE YEN)</h5>	
				<h5 class="text-left">�	GBP/CAD (BRITISH POUND/ CANADIAN DOLLAR)</h5>	
				
								<h4 class="text-left">Base currency</h4>				
<p>In a currency pair, the first currency pair is called the base currency. The base currency is the currency against which the exchange rates are usually quoted. For example, USD/JPY is a currency pair. In this USD is the base currency.</p>
				
				<h4 class="text-left">Quote currency</h4>				
<p>The quote currency is the secondary currency in the currency pair. The quote currency is more commonly called as the �counter currency�. It is the secondary currency that is used to determine the value of the base currency.</p>
				<p>There are two types of quote currencies:</p>
				<p>�	Direct quote- In this type, the quote currency is a foreign currency.</p>
				<p>�	Indirect currency- In this type, the quote currency is the domestic currency.</p>
				
				<h4 class="text-left">PIP</h4>				
<p>Pip is the fundamental unit used to measure while trading currencies. Pip is a standardized unit and also the smallest amount which can cause a currency quote to change. With the help of this unit, huge losses are being saved for investors. For example: If a pip was 10 basis points then one pip change would cause greater volatility in currency values.</p>
					
					<h4 class="text-left">Pipette</h4>				
<p>Various platforms of forex use pips as the smallest fraction that the currency pairs can move but the need for precise accuracy has now produced fractions of one pip which is called pipettes. A pipette is equal to 1/10th (one-tenth) of a pip and it represents a fraction of 1/100000 (one in hundred thousand).</p>
				
											<h4 class="text-left">Bid price</h4>				
<p>It is the highest or maximum price that the buyer's bids or wishes to pay for a currency. The term bid here simply means to ask.</p>
				
																							<h4 class="text-left">Ask price</h4>				
<p>It is the minimum price at which a trader buys the currency pair. </p>
																								
																																							<h4 class="text-left">Bid-Ask spread</h4>				
<p>Bid-Ask spread is the difference between the prices that the dealer will buy a currency pair at and then sell the currency pair. This difference between the buying and selling of a currency is the dealer's profit and this is called the Bid-Ask spread.</p>
																								
<h4 class="text-left">Quote convention</h4>				
<p>Quote convention in forex is based upon the two quotes that are there for any currency, the bid quote, and the ask. Both of them are expressed as the unit of the base transaction.</p>
																								
<h4 class="text-left">Transaction cost</h4>				
<p>Transaction cost generally means the expense that has been incurred while buying and selling a good or service. But here in a financial sense, the transaction cost includes brokers/banks commission for the role that they played. These are the differences between price the dealer paid for a security and the price the buyer pays for the same. This transaction cost is an essential criterion for investors as it will decide the key determinants of net returns.</p>
																								
<h4 class="text-left">Cross currency</h4>				
<p>Cross currency is a pair of currencies traded in the forex market which does not include the US dollar in it. And in the cross-currency transaction, it does not involve the US Dollar as the contract settlement currency. Cross-currency pairs can act as an excellent tool for traders.</p>
	
	<h4 class="text-left">Margin</h4>				
<p>Margin is one of the most important concepts to be understood while trading. A forex margin is a faith that one puts in a deposit that is needed to maintain open positions. It is not a fee or a transaction fee levied on the trader, instead of a portion of your account is set aside and assigned as a margin deposit.  Margin is quite commonly expressed as a percentage of the full amount of the chosen position.</p>
						
		
			<h4 class="text-left">Leverage</h4>				
<p>Leverage in forex is the ratio of the trader�s funds to the size or the price of the broker�s credit. In simple words, leverage is a borrowed capital while trading in forex just to increase the returns in a deal. The leverage is usually much greater than the invested capital by several times. The size of leverage is not fixed at all; it all depends on trading conditions provided by a certain forex broker or bank.</p>
