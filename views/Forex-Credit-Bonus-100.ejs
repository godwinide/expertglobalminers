                                    When a Client makes a withdrawal from their account, they will be subject to a proportionate
                                    removal of the bonus amount awarded. The formula used by the system regarding Bonus Removals
                                    following a withdrawal request is: WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT X 1 (100%).

                                    100% Credit Bonus
                                    For example: If a Client withdraws 100 USD from their account, 100 USD will be deducted automatically
                                    from the 100% bonus amount that had been previously claimed and awarded.

                                    Unless all requirements of the program are met, you can withdraw no more than your original
                                    deposit plus profits (or minus losses) at any time. Once the original deposit is removed, the bonus is
                                    lost. If a part of the original deposit is withdrawn the bonus is removed on a pro rata basis, therefore
                                    there will be a partial bonus removal.

                                    Internal funds transferred between trading Accounts within the Company are considered as
                                    withdrawals, therefore Bonus removal will be applied if the amount being transferred out from the
                                    100% Credit Bonus account is from the original balance that was awarded a respective bonus.
                                    Credit Bonuses cannot be transferred between, or from Eligible Clientsï¿½ trading Accounts within the
