                <p><span>•	Fear:</span> A trader consciously or unconsciously has various kinds of fear while trading. Common fear includes fear of losing everything, failure, and so on.

                <h4 class="text-left">Leverage</h4>
                <p>Leverage in forex is the ratio of the trader’s funds to the size or the price of the broker’s credit. In simple words, leverage is a borrowed capital while trading in forex just to increase the returns in a deal. The leverage in forex usually is much greater than the invested capital by many several times. The size of leverage is not fixed at all; it all depends on trading conditions provided by a certain forex broker or bank.</p>

                <h4 class="text-left">Margin</h4>
                <p>Margin is one of the most important concepts to be understood while trading. A forex margin is a faith that one puts in a deposit that is needed to maintain open positions. It is not a fee or a transaction fee levied on the trader, instead, a portion of your account is set aside and assigned as a margin deposit. Margin is usually written as a unit of the percentage of the entire amount of the position chosen by you.</p>


                <h4 class="text-left">Margin call</h4>
                <p>Margin calls are calls for additional capital or securities to bring in a margin in the account until the minimum maintenance margin is reached. It usually denotes that one or more of the securities held in the margin account has decreased in value below a certain point. For this, the investor can either sell some of the assets held in the account or more money can be deposited in the account.</p>
                
                <h4 class="text-left">How Leverage affects Transaction Cost</h4>
                <p>Leverage call for transaction cost. The higher the leverage the higher transaction costs. Leverage not only amplifies the losses but also amplifies the transaction costs as a percentage of your capital. If your trade balance shrinks your leverage increases. As leverage increases, faster the transaction cost will use up the remaining money in the loss trading account.</p>

                <h4 class="text-left">Be careful while trading on margin</h4>
                <p>Margin enables the trader to enter into larger positions than your account balance. Buying and selling on margin do not provide leverage, it can be used just as a form of leverage. Trading on margin gives the trader a chance to increase the buying and selling power.</p>
