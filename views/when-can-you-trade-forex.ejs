				<h4 class="text-left">Overlapping sessions:</h4>
				<p>Undoubtedly every minute is the best time to trade during the US and UK sessions, which accounts for more than half of all forex trading. When it comes to key sessions like London, New York, and Tokyo, which account for 75% of the market activity trading volume intensifies when the major market sessions overlap, and this is the best time to trade.</p>
				<h4 class="text-left">The best time to trade in the forex market based on trading volume and market activity:</h4>
				<p>The best time to trade when the market sessions overlap with each other is the most appropriate time to trade when the markets are in high liquidity because there are a lot of participants, which means a large volume and momentum increases the movement of currencies where trends rise or sudden decline of currency trends. The best time to trade is when the economic data is released that stimulates currency movement.<br> Therefore, the best time of day to trade currencies is when volatility is high, and the overall trading volume increases when two trading sessions overlap, that is, more than one major open international exchange at the same time. The higher the number of trades, the lower the spreads and higher the volatility. But this does not mean that all trading sessions and overlap between them are equal.</p>
				
				
				<h4 class="text-left">Certain times you should be careful</h4>				
<p>There are also national holidays that change the conditions of the Forex market, such as bank holidays in the United Kingdom or the United States, because without the participation of these countries, the market size and less liquidity than usual.
At times during the day, news and reports affecting the Forex market are released. In these times, its effect can be significant, causing the price to move quickly in one direction and bounce back at the same speed. This is due to the low volume because banks and institutions remain outside the market, causing prices to move quickly in both directions. The publication times of these reports are available in advance and therefore market volatility can be avoided.

								<h4 class="text-left">Best Days of the Week to Trade Forex<br>
Sunday and Monday:                 
</h4>				
<p>When it's Monday morning in Australia, it's still Sunday night in Europe. European and U.S. sessions are not open during this time. The markets are already active, but volatility is relatively low. There won�t get adjusted to the new conditions since there isn't much economic activity on weekends. The night of Sunday is the only time of the trading week when gaps occur regularly for currency pairs. Therefore, Sunday is not the best day to trade the Forex market. This is why it's not recommended to start your trading week on Sunday. Judging by the lack of activity on the market, most traders follow this advice. Monday too doesn�t stand in the list of best to trade currency either. The first half of Monday is sluggish. European traders depend on economic news and macro data and wait for it before they decide to open new orders. As the week begins, traders try to get a feel of future trends and adjust to them. This is why Monday is the least volatile weekday.
</p>
								<h4 class="text-left">Midweek:</h4>				
<p>On Tuesday, trading quickens and the market experiences the first spike inactivity. Market volatility on Tuesday is approximately 120-130% of what it is on Monday. This is the reason why Tuesday is one of the best days to trade Forex. On Wednesday, there is a slight dip in volatility. Trading activity decreases to somewhere in between what it is on Monday and Tuesday. This happens because of a phenomenon known as swaps.
</p>
				<p>To put it simply, a swap is an overnight interest paid by traders who hold their position between daily sessions. For instance, holding a position at the end of Wednesday's session means a triple swap has occurred. However, this is true only in the case that the position was open over the previous weekend. Swaps are not a burden when trading in small volumes. Since most intraday traders don�t opt for trading overnight they never bother about swaps. </p>
				<p>In the case of traders who are long-term traders or those who operate huge volume, a positive triple swap can generate profit. That's why Wednesday is generally a bit lower in volatility compared with Tuesday and Thursday. Thursday is another excellent day to trade the Forex market because of its high volatility.</p>
				
																<h4 class="text-left">Friday:</h4>				
<p>Something interesting happens on Fridays. The currency pairs that are popular during the Asian and European sessions begin to overlap. They stay almost as volatile as they are on Thursday. Mostly, we are talking about the EUR/JPY and the GBP/JPY currency pairs. Meanwhile, pairs of North America and Asia Pacific currencies drop in volume. This is because the market closes on Friday night. Generally, the first half of Friday sees a lot of trading action and provides good conditions for trading.
</p>
				<p>Keep in mind that volumes drop significantly in the second half of the day as the weekend approaches.</p>
				<p>Forex is an international market that is open 24-hours. This market consists of banks, commercial companies, management firms, and hedge funds. Grow your calendar to incorporate perusing news discharges, examining potential trades, and promoting your general Forex knowledge. Doing so will improve your trading achievement..</p>
